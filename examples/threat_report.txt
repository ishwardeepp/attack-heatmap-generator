Threat Intelligence Report: APT Campaign Analysis
Date: February 15, 2024
Analyst: Security Research Team

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This report details a sophisticated cyber campaign targeting financial institutions 
observed between January and February 2024. The threat actors demonstrated advanced 
capabilities across multiple attack phases.

INITIAL ACCESS
The campaign began with spearphishing attacks (T1566.001) targeting employees in 
the finance department. Malicious Microsoft Office documents were weaponized with 
macros that executed PowerShell commands (T1059.001) to establish initial foothold.

EXECUTION
Upon successful compromise, the actors leveraged Windows Command Shell (T1059.003) 
and Windows Management Instrumentation (T1047) for command execution. Scheduled 
tasks (T1053.005) were created for persistence.

PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
The threat actors attempted to dump credentials from LSASS memory (T1003.001) and 
accessed the NTDS database (T1003.003) on domain controllers. Valid accounts (T1078) 
were then used for lateral movement.

DEFENSE EVASION
Multiple defense evasion techniques were observed:
- Process injection via DLL injection (T1055.001) and process hollowing (T1055.012)
- Obfuscation of malicious files (T1027) including software packing (T1027.002)
- Clearing Windows event logs (T1070.001) and deleting files (T1070.004)
- Disabling security tools (T1562.001)
- Registry modifications (T1112) to maintain persistence

LATERAL MOVEMENT
The actors moved laterally using:
- Remote Desktop Protocol (T1021.001)
- SMB and Windows Admin Shares (T1021.002)

DISCOVERY
Extensive reconnaissance was conducted:
- System information discovery (T1082)
- File and directory discovery (T1083)
- Process discovery (T1057)
- Remote system discovery (T1018)
- Network configuration discovery (T1016)
- Network connections discovery (T1049)

COMMAND AND CONTROL
Communication with C2 infrastructure utilized:
- Standard web protocols (T1071.001)
- DNS tunneling (T1071.004)
Tool transfer was accomplished via T1105 (Ingress Tool Transfer).

RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Implement email security controls to detect T1566.001
2. Deploy endpoint detection for T1059.001 and T1059.003
3. Monitor for T1003.001 and T1003.003 credential access attempts
4. Restrict RDP (T1021.001) and SMB (T1021.002) access
5. Enable comprehensive logging to detect T1070.001

CONCLUSION
This campaign demonstrates sophisticated TTPs requiring defense-in-depth strategies
and continuous monitoring across the kill chain.
